 |        Important bug corrections in versions 1.0 and 1.1           |
 |                                                                    |
 | The usage of the BLAS function ISAMAX is incorrect in the two sub- |
 | routines MAXDEL and GRIDINIT: the stride for the 2-d arrays of the |
 | type "rhs(#,ngrs)" is set equal to "1" instead of "meqn" resulting |
 | in incorrect values for "kx(#)". The resulting wrong estimates for | 
 | the sizes of the correction vectors (c.f. the TITAN Code Reference |
 | Manual, XVII.A) still lead to trustworthy solutions as soon as the |
 | code has converged at each timestep!                               |
 | ISAMAX is correctly employed in the subroutine TIMSTP for the 2-d  |
 | array "sx(ngrs,#)", and in all instances with 1-d arrays.          |
 |                                                                    |
 | Two terms of the total energy in TOTNRG do not  properly represent |
 | the formulae in the  TITAN Code Reference Manual, XI.B .  The term |
 | TE3 is corrected by introducing a new array  "tescr0(#)"  which is |
 | set in START## and marks the zero time total energy.  The term TE4 |
 | is changed for the correct time centering of variables.            |
 |                                                                    |
 | Users who wish to continue working with versions 1.0/1.1 are asked |
 | to carry out these  bugs fix themselves.  The exact changes can be |
 | found from file comparisons with version 1.2.                      |
 +--------------------------------------------------------------------+

The main objective of version 1.2 is a change in the mass variable from
"interior" mass "xm", measured outward from the center, to "exterior"
mass "xme", measured inward from the outer surface. This now enables the
user to consider problems in self-gravitating flows in which the gravita-
ting mass is dominated by a very large inner mass (e.g. accretion onto a
compact object). Or flows in strongly gravitationally stratified media 
(e.g. stellar envelopes) where the masses of zones in the outer layers
are many (12 - 15) orders of magnitude smaller than those of the inner
zones.

The model initialization can be adapted from an old START## routine with 
merely one new DO loop (DO 155) which links "xme" to "xm" via the constant 
"xmtot", as described below:

Let "xmass" denote the total interior (gravitational) mass out to the 
outer boundary (i.e. the stellar mass, or mass of the computational domain
if there is a zero mass contribution from inside the inner boundary). Out-
side of this boundary we allow for the possible existence of an external
mass "xmext", which contributes only a constant to the gravitational poten-
tial inside (spherical symmetry). This outer mass could serve, for example,
as a reservoir for mass accretion across the outer boundary. If there is
no mass flow across the outer boundary (i.e. a lagrangean boundary or an
eulerian boundary with phir0 = 0.0) "xmext" is not needed and should be 
set to zero. In addition to any external mass, there can be an internal
or central mass inside the inner boundary which produces gravitational 
forces from regions inside the inner boundary.

The parameters "xmass" and "xmext" are either read in and/or determined in 
the problem setup, i.e. at time t=0:

            xmass = xmn (ngre+2)                 (initial stellar mass)
            xmext = xmen(ngre+2)                 (outer mass reservoir)

The total mass "xmtot" is then given by the sum:

	    xmtot = xmass + xmext

This quantity is computed at the model initialization and remains fixed 
in time. The interior and exterior masses are then related at all times 
by the transformation:

            xmn(k) = xmtot - xmen(k)             (k=ngrs-1,ngre+2)

The user is asked to look into the new START## routines for examples. In
order to carry over ones favourite problem one should cut out the initi-
alization part from the old START{01,02} and paste it into the template
of the new START{01,02} along with the conversion loop DO 155. The parameter
settings at the beginning of the subroutine should then be adjusted. This
procedure should allow for an easy transition to the new code version and
generate a new setup which is consistent within its framework.

Three new output files are offered with this version. They are controlled 
via the input file titan.in as described in the TITAN Code User's Guide, 
IV.B . The formatted output file with the suffix ".nrg" allows the user to
monitor the energy conservation as a function of time. The corresponding 
name is "energy". The output file with the suffix ".hdf" and name "hdf"
generates a data set in NCSA's HDF format specification. This is intended 
to be used in conjunction with an interactive, real time IDL browser for 
graphical displays. Since this necessitates that the user has IDL installed 
only a dummy interface in the form of the two subroutines HDFINIT and HSTORE 
is released to the general public. A comprehensible interface is under deve-
lopment and accessible to interested IDL users. The formatted output file
with the suffix ".tty" allows the user to reroute the standard /dev/tty
which is useful if one wished to run the code in batch/production mode.
The corresponding name is "rtty". The tty is the default output if this
option is not invoked.

A new logical variable, called the verbosity flag "ltalk", permits the 
user to control the amount of output to the tty and the ".out" file di-
rectly via the input file titan.in. The possible settings are as follows:
 +-----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
 | ltalk = 0 | suppression of time step information both to tty and   |
 |           | ####.out file.                                         |
 +-----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
 | ltalk = 1 | minimal output to tty consisting of final convergence  |
 |           | notice per time step plus printout of the total energy |
 |           | every 10 time steps;                                   |
 |	     | detailed output to the ####.out file consisting of all |
 |	     | iteration information and energy monitoring for every  |
 |	     | time step.                                             |
 +-----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
 | ltalk = 2 | detailed output to the tty and the ####.out file.      |
 +-----------+--------------------------------------------------------+

The new possibilities of the input file are illustrated on the example of
problem 3, Sod's shock tube:
 +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
 |    4                                                               |
 |    6    output  SOD.out        new                                 |
 |    7      dump  SOD.dmp        new                                 |
 |    8    energy  SOD.nrg        new                                 |

 +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
There are now three output files indicated by "4" in the first line. The
fourth line accesses the energy monitor which is written into the file
SOD.nrg. The fifth line reroutes the standard output to the file SOD.tty.
The sixth line now contains three integers: the first two having the usual 
meaning, and the last one setting the verbosity flag ltalk = 1. For further 
explanations see the TITAN Code User's Guide, IV.B .

The following subroutines have been modified, either slightly to correct
bugs or improve the coding style, or significantly by introducing incom-
patible changes to the earlier versions:

 | ARCHIVE        GRID      OPAC         RESET    UPDATE{H,R,RH}      |
