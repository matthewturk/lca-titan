   TITAN was designed, implemented and documented by Dimitri Mihalas and
   Michael Gehmeyr,  and is  funded in  part by grants from the National
   Science Foundation grants  AST-8914143 and  AST-920113, the  National
   Aeronautics and  Space  Administration grant  90-NASA-M-1665, and re-
   search funds made available by the University of Illinois.
  
   TITAN is a one-dimensional  implicit adaptive-grid radiation hydrody-
   namics code.  It is written in  standard FORTRAN 77 in a  modular and
   portable fashion.  It is  being given away  free of charge to  inter-
   ested researchers. It comes with no warranty.
  
   This distribution contains all  the subroutines and libraries used to
   build the program.  It also contains a  series of initialization rou-
   tines that  allow the user to  run and benchmark various  simple test
   problems. Finally, a dummy interface to an interactive graphics brow-
   ser (linked to IDL software) comes with this release. The browser and
   enabling software can be requested from the authors or the LCA.
 
   There is a  "user's guide" for the program itself  as well as for the
   test problems  and a detailed "reference manual" for many of the sub-
   routines. There is no online help.
 
   This is the third release: TITAN 1.2 . It is intended for the general
   public. Great care has been given to make the program as  bug-free as 
   possible,  and as far as  the authors  can tell, there are no serious
   bugs that affect the performance and results of the numerical experi-
   ments run with it.
   
   TITAN 1.2 has been compiled, run and tested on the following platforms:
              +----------------------------------------+
              | SPARC | Station 2        | Solaris 2.4 |
              | SPARC | Station 10       | SunOS 4.1.3 |
              |   SGI | Power Challenge  | IRIX  5.3   |
              |   SGI | Indigo 2 Extreme | IRIX  5.3   |
              +----------------------------------------+
   TITAN is  expected to also run on  other machines with possibly small
   modifications, but no guarantees are given. In particular, TITAN con-
   tains special features that vectorize it on CRAY supercomputers.  You
   must  make the  necessary  modifications in the  source  code and the
   makefile yourself.
 
   Building TITAN:  before you build  TITAN, make  sure you have  all of
   the necessary source files. TITAN comes in one package in form of the
   compressed tar-file "titan_tar.gz" which contains  all of the source,
   as well as additional software (BLAS, LINPACK, CRAYPACK). The startup 
   and writing routines are at the  user level  which means that you can
   edit them when you try out  different versions or  modifications of a 
   given test problem. Begin with uncompressing (unzipping) and untaring 
   the file titan_tar.gz. Then type "make" in order to compile the entire 
   source code and to load them into the  executable called "titan.x". A 
   building protocol looks like this:
 
              mkdir titan
              cd titan
              zcat titan_tar.gz | tar xvf -
              make 
 
   You now can try all the benchmarks. If you edit one of the start rou-
   tines you can recompile TITAN by simply typing "make titan". For your 
   favourite problems we have reserved the routines  start01 and start02
   to generate the initial models. You have to write them yourself. Also
   you have to  take care of the  code's output in  writout and writsty.
   These subroutines then are compiled by the same command "make titan".  
   TITAN then is ready to execute.
 
   Bug reporting or questions:  there is a mailing list for people using
   TITAN.  It is primarily intended for discussion of issues relating to
   TITAN's  algorithm   and dissemination of information directly related
   to its usage.  The list will also be used to announce any bug fixes, 
   updates and release news. 
 
   If you have bug reports or questions remain after carefully reading 
   both the TITAN Code User Guide and the TITAN Code Reference manual,
   we may be reached by e-mail through:
 
              lca@ncsa.uiuc.edu
  
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   UNRESOLVED PROBLEMS AND TEMPORARY FIXES
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Despite  careful  checking, we find it somewhat  disturbing  that the 
   identical  FORTRAN code  does  NOT  produce  identical results on all 
   machines. Further, we have not yet tested the cray version. If you can 
   identify  the  sources of these  problems, please let us know.  It is 
   possible that this problem is related to the one described below.
